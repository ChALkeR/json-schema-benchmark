# json-schema-benchmark
Performance benchmark for Node.js JSON-schema validators.

Also tests against [official JSON-schema test suite](https://github.com/json-schema/JSON-Schema-Test-Suite) and checks
for validators that cause side-effects on schema or data.

(validators not in the results above where excluded because of failing tests - see below for details)

[`@exodus/schemasafe`](https://github.com/ExodusMovement/schemasafe) is currently the fastest JSON-schema validator out there.

The fastest validator has 100%, the rest a lower score relative to the fastest.
If a validator has a score of 5% that means that it's speed is 5% of the fastest,
meaning that it's 20 times slower than the fastest.

# Test failure summary

This test suite uses the [official JSON-schema test suite](https://github.com/json-schema/JSON-Schema-Test-Suite).

If a validator does not pass a test in the official test suite, it will show up in these results.

Some validators have deliberately chosen not to support parts of the spec. Go to the homepage of the validator to learn if
that is the case for these tests.

# Side-effects summary

Number of tests that caused side-effects. The schema or data was altered by the validator.

|Validator|Number of side-effects (BAD)|
|---------|----------------------------|
|[`jsonschema`](https://github.com/tdegrunt/jsonschema#readme)|[4](https://github.com/ebdrup/json-schema-benchmark/blob/master/reports/jsonschema-side-effects.md)|

|[`json-model`](https://github.com/geraintluff/json-model)|[995](https://github.com/ebdrup/json-schema-benchmark/blob/master/reports/json-model-side-effects.md)|

Validators not in the list have no side-effects on data or schemas.

# Features of validators

Note that these benchmarks and tests do not take into account other more advanced features of the validators. I encourage
you to take a look at each validator if you are looking for special features.

# Benchmarks by validator authors and others

Several of the validators have build benchmarks themselves. They are
more detailed then the benchmarks provided above.
