# [`@cfworker/json-schema`](https://github.com/cfworker/cfworker/tree/master/packages/json-schema/README.md) - test summary

# All validators fail this test

`ECMA 262 \s matches ascii whitespace only, latin-1 non-breaking-space does not match (unlike e.g. Python)`

`Proper UTF-16 surrogate pair handling: patternProperties, doesn&#39;t match two`

`some languages do not distinguish between different types of numeric value, a float is not an integer even without fractional part`

# [`@cfworker/json-schema`](https://github.com/cfworker/cfworker/tree/master/packages/json-schema/README.md) failed tests

Some validators have deliberately chosen not to support parts of the spec. Go to the [`@cfworker/json-schema`](https://github.com/cfworker/cfworker/tree/master/packages/json-schema/README.md) homepage to learn if
that is the case for these tests.

|test failed|reason
|-----------|------
`ECMA 262 \S matches everything but ascii whitespace, latin-1 non-breaking-space matches (unlike e.g. Python)`|Expected result: `true` but validator returned: `false`
`Proper UTF-16 surrogate pair handling: pattern, matches empty`|Expected result: `true` but validator returned: `false`
`Proper UTF-16 surrogate pair handling: pattern, matches two`|Expected result: `true` but validator returned: `false`

**All other tests passed**.
