# [`jsen`](https://github.com/bugventure/jsen) - test summary

# All validators fail this test

`ECMA 262 \s matches ascii whitespace only, latin-1 non-breaking-space does not match (unlike e.g. Python)`

`Proper UTF-16 surrogate pair handling: patternProperties, doesn&#39;t match two`

`some languages do not distinguish between different types of numeric value, a float is not an integer even without fractional part`

# [`jsen`](https://github.com/bugventure/jsen) failed tests

Some validators have deliberately chosen not to support parts of the spec. Go to the [`jsen`](https://github.com/bugventure/jsen) homepage to learn if
that is the case for these tests.
